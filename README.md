This research focused on a weak supervision strategy for deep learning to enhance high-resolution (sub-meter) land cover from historical pseudo (noise) labels published in IEEE Transactions on GeoScience and Remote Sensing Journal (Download Data [[here](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/11124258)]). The study involved developing a deep learning architecture that could be supervised using unified noise or imbalanced datasets as a reasonable training set during the knowledge acquisition phase. The main concern was overcoming the barriers of spatial resolution mismatch between pairs of machine learning to train sets derived from high-resolution images representing complex urban features and rural image features, regardless of photogrammetric and landform heterogeneity.
